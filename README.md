Riya and Avni are two sisters who own and operate a small café business that sells desserts and coffee. There parents have supported them in this a long way. Right now the cafe is only asseccible online.
The café currently doesn’t have a marketing strategy. They mostly gain new customers when someone visits or recommends their website and decides to try it. The café has a reputation for high-quality desserts and coffees, but their reputation is limited to people who have visited, or who have heard about them from their customers.
Their family and friends suggests to them that they should expand community awareness of what the café has to offer. The café doesn’t have a physical presence yet, and it doesn’t currently use any cloud computing services. However, that situation is about to change.
